h1. My Bash Profile

This is the bash profile I use across all my macs and some of my servers. Its pretty general and can be used on almost any machine. This is all really heavily influenced by "Mat Schaffer":https://github.com/matschaffer/profile and the mess of peeps that have forked and contributed to his profile. My needs started getting too far from what he was doing so I pulled over a bunch of stuff and made it more my own.

h2. Usage

Fork my .profile.d repo on github

1. Go home
<pre><code>cd ~</code></pre>

2. Clone the repository (replace my username with yours)
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:timmyfury/profile.d.git .profile.d</code></pre>

3. All *.conf files are loaded alphabetically, so this will retain your original settings
<pre><code>mv .profile .profile.d/z_myoldsettings.conf</code></pre>

4. Setup a sym to .profile.d/init. That kicks off the whole thing
<pre><code>ln -s .profile.d/init .profile</code></pre>

5. Make sure you don't have any .bash_profile or .bashrc hanging out which might override .profile

6. Reload your profile
<pre><code>source .profile</code></pre>

h2. Some Stuff You Should Know

* Things that are specific to individual flavors are separated into flavor specific directories. (e.g. Linux, Darwin).
* Some assumptions are made about where applications are installed. You may need to change those parts for yourself. I've made notes in the "Other Jawns Installed":#other-jawns-installed section of this page.

This is my *OSX Post Install Guide*. First comes first, run your updates.
